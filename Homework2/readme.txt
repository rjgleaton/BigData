Ralph Gleaton - Homework 2
CSCE 587

The given homework file didn't specify much in the way of formatting or what exactly we're supposed to turn in. My predicted values for part 3 are very poor though it's difficult to fix without making changes to the kernel used, though that takes up too many resources and my computer can't run it.

I will do my best to document the location of all relavent items in the notebook file.
